# Changes to the game modes page:

1.  Currently thereâ€™s a container which contains the main content (which is the gadget/star power image on gadget and star power modes, the play button & hint section on audio mode, the pixelated image in pixels mode, the attribute square in classic mode {same as in the daily classic mode}), search bar, guesses left, and previous guess. I want you to remove this container, but only the container itself , not anything inside it.  i think the name of this container is div.survival-mode-card-content but im not sure.

3. Change the size, looks, and outline of the main content square (which is the gadget/star power image on gadget and star power modes, the play button & hint section on audio mode, the pixelated image in pixels mode, the attribute square in classic mode {same as in the daily classic mode}) to be exactly the same as in the daily modes on both mobile and PC. note that currently, the main content square of audio mode looks very different from the daily audio mode. all of them needs to be adjusted to look like the daily modes ones but the survival audio currently has the most difference gap of them all. the survival classic completely lacks the attribute square, which makes him have even bigger difference gap than daily mode and it must be copied from the daily classic mode.this change should only affect survival mode.to simplify this, do it by first looking at the main content square of each of the daily game modes, then just copy its design, outline, size, to the survival game modes (copy the main content square of the daily classic to the survival classic, copy the main content square of the daily gadget to the survival gadget, etc. for all 5 modes.)
