  - Root files previously created for context: `Issues & Bugs.md`, `Brawldle-PRD-Portfolio-Outline.md`, `Brawldle-PRD-Portfolio.md`.

- 2025-08-11 (later updates)
  - Added: `Remediation-Plan.md`; linked in INDEX.
  - Added: `Edge-Functions-and-Automation.md`; linked in INDEX.
  - Updated: `System-Architecture.md` evidence to include `supabase/functions/generate-daily-challenges/index.ts` and `supabase/functions/cron-setup/index.ts`.
  - Verified: Supabase client and types live at `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` and `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`.
