Project Rules

Audience & Clarity
- Always communicate in simple, accessible language suitable for non‑technical readers.
- Prefer brevity; use concise explanations and avoid unnecessary jargon.

Context & Reconnaissance
- Always read relevant files and data structures before making changes (read before write).
- Verify assumptions empirically via code or configuration inspection.

Data & Types
- Keep mock or placeholder data generation isolated and easily replaceable.
- Update type definitions/models promptly when feature scope or categories expand.

Filtering & Selection
- Implement deterministic filter behavior: if single‑select is required, selecting one option deselects others; re‑selecting the same option should clear selection only if specified.

UI & Layout
- Implement layouts exactly per specification; remove non‑essential UI when minimalism is requested.
- Ensure responsive grids and compact spacing when a dense layout is desired.

Metrics & Counts
- Derive counts and summaries from the currently filtered dataset, not from static totals.

Change Safety & Reporting
- Make minimal, reversible changes and provide a brief summary of modifications after each change.
