# ðŸ’¡ AI Project Instructions â€“ Read Before Any Task

## ðŸ“¦ Package Manager

This project uses **Bun** exclusively.  
Absolutely **do not use `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`** in any instructions, commands, prompts, or automation.  


If you need to add packages or scripts, **assume Bun is the only available tool**.

## ðŸ§  AI Prompt Behavior Guidelines

You are assisting a non-coder. Every answer must:
1. Be easy to understand for non-coders
2. Assume the user has **Bun already installed** and wants **no exposure to npm/yarn**.
3. Show only Bun-compatible commands.
