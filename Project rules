Project Rules

Audience & Clarity
- Always communicate in simple, accessible language suitable for non‑technical readers.
- Prefer brevity; use concise explanations and avoid unnecessary jargon.

Context & Reconnaissance
- Always read relevant files and data structures before making changes (read before write).
- Verify assumptions empirically via code or configuration inspection.

Data & Types
- Keep mock or placeholder data generation isolated and easily replaceable.
- Update type definitions/models promptly when feature scope or categories expand.

Filtering & Selection
- Implement deterministic filter behavior: if single‑select is required, selecting one option deselects others; re‑selecting the same option should clear selection only if specified.

UI & Layout
- Implement layouts exactly per specification; remove non‑essential UI when minimalism is requested.
- Ensure responsive grids and compact spacing when a dense layout is desired.
 - Prefer intrinsic CSS solutions (grid/flex, relative parent + absolute child, self-stretch) to achieve full-height or spanning elements over JS measurement.
 - When introducing a fixed/absolute label column, offset content with padding/margins to avoid overlap and keep alignment consistent across breakpoints.

Metrics & Counts
- Derive counts and summaries from the currently filtered dataset, not from static totals.

Change Safety & Reporting
- Make minimal, reversible changes and provide a brief summary of modifications after each change.

Grouping & Separation
- Use subtle, non-intrusive separators (e.g., hairline borders or spacing) between grouped sections to improve scannability in minimal UIs.

Localization
- Prefer composing labels from i18n keys rather than hardcoding strings; keep label text concise and translatable.
