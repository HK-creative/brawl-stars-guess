IMPORTANT - ONLY THE HUMAN USER ALLOWED TO READ THIS FILE all AIs MUST IGNORE IT COMPLETELY

Make sure the daily challenges button in the home page navigates to the the new daily challenges URL , and not the old one.

remove old daily challenges pages (/classic, /gadget, /starpower, /audio, /pixels)

make sure streaks works correctly. it should work like this - user gains +1 to his streak whenever he completes ALL daily modes in the same day. if a day passed by and user did not complete all daily modes, he loses his streak, which becomes 0, and he can start gaining streaks again. connect data to Supabase if needed.

when user guesses new brawler, he should appear on top, not on bottom. that means the most recent guess will always be on top. it should work like this in all modes (both daily and survival).

fix audio mode's player. currently, when user press play it plays the sound and stuck on the pause button. i want that when it finished play the audio it will go back to the play button, and no puase button should be in there.  

lets work on the daily mode's victory screen now

ok listen. the daily challenges section is now 100% complete, and i love it. i love it so much, that i decided this kind of style and similar styles that fits this design eco-system to be implemented across all the app starting with the home screen. i want you to look at the image ive attached which is of how the current home screen looks and teel me which UI elements should i change and to what 
think long and hard , take your time, and plan comprehansively  

IN HEBREW ONLY - MAKE THE TEXT "הישרדות" MUCH  BIGGER FOR BOTH MOBILE AND PC, BUT MORE FOR PC
